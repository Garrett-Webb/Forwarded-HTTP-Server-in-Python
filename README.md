## Citations:
* I used the built-in http server module in python, and used the docs here to get started. `https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html`
* I glanced at this website, which details the code structure of a simple httpserver implementation in python, but I did not copy any of the code aside from that which was used in the official python documentation. `https://stackabuse.com/serving-files-with-pythons-simplehttpserver-module/`

## Acknowledgements:
* one student `kai hsieh` helped me with configuring docker on my computer, however no code was shared.

## Notes
* I am sorry about the fact that I added all the completed files in one go to this repository, I should have made the repo first and committed as I went, but I did not fully read the submission workflow part of the assignment until I had finished the code. I will remedy this in future assignments.
